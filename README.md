## Overview:

The Harsh Environment CubeSat Payload is the result of a partnership between the Space Technology Research Laboratory (UFSC-Brazil) and the Space Radiation Research Group (LIRMM-France). It was developed by Andre Mattos as part of the undegraduate final thesis. 

The payload was designed to evaluate and test three different manufacture node SDR SDRAM memories in harsh environments. Also, other experiments are performed to analyse the effects in performance of critical paraments in these devices. The board is compatible with the OBDH FloripaSat-II DaughterBoard standard.
